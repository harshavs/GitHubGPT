GitHubGPT: GitHub Code Generation AI Model

-------

> **_NOTE:_**  This repository is not complete. It is still a work in progress. The descriptions below outline the goals of this repository.

GitHubGPT is a powerful GPT plugin allowing you to analyze, explore, and extract insights from code repositories hosted on GitHub.

By leveraging the functionalities of the GitHub API, GitHubGPT facilitates the retrieval of code files from any GitHub repository. It enables you to specify the repository URL and effortlessly fetches the contents, including various code files. This plugin supports both public and private repositories, granting you access to a wide range of codebases.

This empowers developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to gain a deeper understanding of the code, explore potential solutions, and receive assistance in real-time.

GitHubGPT streamlines the process of analyzing code repositories, eliminating the need for manual exploration or switching between different tools and platforms. It enables you to leverage the power of AI-driven natural language processing directly within your GitHub workflow.

This project aims to develop an AI model that can read and generate code specifically for a particular GitHub repository. The model utilizes the power of Hugging Face's models in Python to generate code suggestions and completions based on given prompts or requirements.

## Project Overview

The GitHub Code Generation AI Model follows the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Given a GitHub repository link, the model collects code samples from all files within the repository. It utilizes the GitHub API or web scraping techniques to retrieve the code snippets.
2. Data Preprocessing: The collected code samples undergo preprocessing to ensure they are in a suitable format for training. This involves removing comments, standardizing code formatting, and handling any specific code syntax or language requirements.
3. Model Training: Hugging Face's Transformers library is used to train a language model. Transfer learning techniques are employed to fine-tune a pre-trained model, such as GPT-3 or GPT-2, on the code dataset.
4. Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated on a validation set using appropriate metrics for code generation tasks. This evaluation helps assess the model's capabilities and identify areas for improvement.
5. Code Generation: The trained model is then utilized to generate code suggestions and completions. Given prompts or specific requirements, the model generates code snippets that align with the desired functionality, leveraging its understanding of the codebase from the training process.
